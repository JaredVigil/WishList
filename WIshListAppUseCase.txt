This Google doc will be a list of different  use cases / functionality the WishList App should be able to do. They are in three different categories of  functions. The first category of use cases / functionality will be the basic functions that the WishList App is required to do. These  use cases / functions will be the core of what the app will do and the first implemented into the design. The second category of functionality will be short term use cases / function goals for the WishList App. These functions will be not be essential to what the app will need to perform but will be additional functionality to help make user experience easier or new features that make the app more useful to the user. The last category of use cases / functionality will be long term function goals. These functions will again not be essential to what the app needs to do but addition functionality that we would like to see in the app one day in the future. These long term goal may be functions that make the app more profitable or expand in size.
